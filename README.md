# Path Visualizer

Findind Shortest Path Between Two Nodes

## Algorithms Available :

```
Disjktra and A* Algorithm
```
## How to Use : 

- Execute the code in the jupyter notebook (visualization.ipynb) 
OR Run the Path.py script.
- Press left mouse button(LMB) to select the starting node.
- Press right mouse button(RMB) to select the destination node once starting point is set.
- Once source and destination are set, Use LMB to declare some nodes as walls or press r to generate a randomized maze (press multiple times to increase density)
- Run the desired Algorithm
 
## Key Mappings

|  Key | Action  |
|---|---|
| RMB   | Clear a cell  |
| LBM | Selecting Src/Dst/Wall  |
| A  | Run A*  |
| D  | Run Dijkstra  |
| R  | Generate A Randomized Maze  |
| C  | Clear All  |
| U  | Undo |
